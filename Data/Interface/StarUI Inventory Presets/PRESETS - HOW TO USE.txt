==============
Presets folder
==============

The files in the presets folder aren't used by the game interface.
If you like to use a preset, copy the file (or the content) to one of these files: 

StarUI Inventory (default).ini
OR: 
StarUI Inventory.ini

Note: The last file doesn't exist by default. You can create it to store your settings in a update-safe location.
The file will be read last and can overwrite any settings in the default INI.
